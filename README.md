### Admin UI for DDF

A "Ship of Theseus" replacement for the existing DDF Admin UI. Backbone / Marionette (jquery, etc) dependencies have all been removed.

For now it's a replica, but we can start to build new areas and diverge. It also supports extensions for downstream DDFs to hook into, allowing them to customize their Admin UI.
